** What is Git
[[https:/en.wikipedia.org][Git]] is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. 
It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 
Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
